   * ":checked" selector to *only* select the input when it is checked. We then use the immediate sibling 
   * selector(+) to select the span, and then it's pseudo element :after(What we are using to mark the button)
   * Because we already styled the :after, all we have to do is set the opacity to 1, making it fade in.
